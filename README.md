# lclpatch
Code to extend the Lazarus Component Library with some useful functions. 

Examples: 

1. You can adjust a form on all systems to be in view, when it is created, by calling a procedure from this package.
2. You can make a GUI app with several top level forms or a solution similarly to MDI but not limited to a platform. This is described in my artice at https://medium.com/@jakobsche/gui-application-with-unlimited-number-of-top-level-forms-384df3d1a8e4?source=friends_link&sk=07131cbcd547a248efb241e042b385f5
