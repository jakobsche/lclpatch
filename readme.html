    <h2>Use in projects</h2>
    
    <p>Open the Project Inspector inside your project. Add the package lclpatch to your project. Then you can use what the package provides in your project.</p>
    
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    
    <p>You need fpdoc being installed. To generate readable package documentation open a console, then switch to the package directory. From there call <code>./make-dp</code>. This creates documentation project files depending on the current state of the package documentation. Then call <code>./make-doc</code>. This creates readable package documentation from the previously created project file. You can find it by comparing the directory content before and after that.</p>
